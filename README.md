# SISOvsMIMO
Project Overview

This project presents the design, simulation, and performance analysis of a MIMO-based 5G wireless communication system and compares it with a conventional SISO (Single-Input Single-Output) system.

The focus is on evaluating:

Channel Capacity improvement

BER (Bit Error Rate) performance

Reliability enhancement in fading channels

The study demonstrates why MIMO is a key enabling technology in 5G NR.

 Objectives

Design SISO and MIMO (2×2 / 4×4) wireless systems

Compare channel capacity vs SNR

Analyze BER performance under Rayleigh fading

Demonstrate spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing gains

Validate 5G physical-layer advantages



Multiplexing

Beamforming (conceptually)
